# Perivascular-Space-Volume-analysis

##Introduction
Perivascular Spaces (PVS), or Virchow-Robin Spaces, are fluid-filled cavities surrounding the brain’s blood vessels that aid in interstitial fluid drainage. Their expansion or contraction has been implicated in various neurological conditions, yet the specific factors influencing these changes are not well understood. 

##Methods
Using cross-sectional MRI data from a neuroimaging sub-study of dementia in older Indians (n = 113, aged 60-87), we investigated the associations between dementia risk factors and PVS volume. PVS volume was quantified from T1 weighted images. We created baseline linear regression models associating PVS volume in white matter (WM) and basal ganglia (BG) regions with age, sex, education, estimated intracranial volume, white matter hyperintensity volume, and regional brain volume. Socioeconomic, lifestyle, environmental, and health-related risk factors were added iteratively, recording each model’s R². We also utilized a simple mediation model. 

##Results
Air pollution (PM2.5) explained the most additional variance, at 28% and 12% in WM and BG PVS, respectively. Increased air pollution, correlated with urban living, was linked to increased PVS volume. Air pollution mediated the association between urban/rural status and PVS volume, where the proportion mediated was 78% in WM PVS (95% CI: 45% - 99%) and 44% in BG PVS (95% CI:11% - 99%). 

##Conclusion
Here, for the first time, we show that air pollution both leads to an increase in brain PVS volume and mediates the association between urbanicity and PVS volume in older, cognitively normal Indians. Due to India’s extremely high air pollution levels and scarcity of prior MRI-based dementia studies, our study offers a unique insight into air pollution’s effects on PVS, though further study is needed to further understand how air pollution affects the brain.
